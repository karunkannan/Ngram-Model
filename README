Description: This program is a languge processer that uses a Ngram model. It is able
to train from multiple models, and can produce randomly generated outputs based on
commands.

Files:
	a8.cpp: The driver of the program. This file uses the Language model class to
		drive the program.
	LanguageModel.cpp: This program contains functions that manipulate the Language
			   Model. This includes functions that build the model, print
			   it to a string, as well as generates random output.
	NgramCollection.cpp: Files that manipulate the actual map of Ngrams, and stores
			     all important values. Contains fucntions, to insert words,
			     print to string, and pick words for sentence generation.

Thoughts: Again very interesting assignment. Made me more comfortable with C++. The project
	  roughly 10-12 hours again. Unit Testing was difficult to intially wrtie for the
	  Language Model unit tests.

Pitfalls: Should take care of errors, did not have time to finish the Language Model unit tests,
	  I did test the functions with regular testing. Unfortunately, I have an exam that I really
	  need to study for so had to make the game time deicison to take an L. Sorry!
